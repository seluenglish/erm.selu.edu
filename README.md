#While Defining a route in backend
###make sure that you define route in following order
        
   
    rootRouter
        .use(apiRouter.routes())
        /* render error page when problem found */
        .get('/getNews', ctx=>getNews(ctx) )
        .post('/createNews', ctx=>setNews(ctx) )

###Before the following route or else the app will render a page not api        
        .get('error', '/oops', renderReactApp)
        /* render react app for all other routes */
        .get('react', '/(.*)', renderReactApp)

### Get the data in post request:
    ctx.request.body
    
        would later base his critique of the pathetic fallacy.</p>
                                 </div>
                             </div>
                         </body>
                     </text>
                 </TEI>
